## TTS Models Comparison and Implementation: Parler TTS, xTTS, gTTS, Nixtts

This repository provides an in-depth analysis and comparison of four popular Text-to-Speech (TTS) models: **Parler TTS, xTTS, gTTS**, and **Nixtts**. Based on our evaluations, **Nixtts** stands out as the most efficient and high-quality TTS model. This README outlines each model's features, setup, usage, and a final recommendation.

## Models Overview

1. **Parler TTS** - Known for high-quality voice synthesis, but limited by its larger model size and longer generation time.
2. **xTTS** - Offers flexibility and multilingual support, though its performance can vary significantly based on input language and accent.
3. **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** - Lightweight and quick to set up, gTTS is ideal for basic tasks but lacks customization and fine-tuning options.
4. **Nixtts** - The most advanced and preferred model in our study, Nixtts provides exceptional voice naturalness, customizable parameters, and efficiency in both inference time and resource usage.
